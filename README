# Description of the project

This project is an attempt to create a website for "FTC - Byens hyggeløbeklub", a newly formed community running club. It provides information about the club, weekly training programs, events, and allows users to join the club or contact the team. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is of course not a complete website, but rather a first draft of a potential website for FTC. Be aware that you do not access Facebook and Instragram by clicking on the buttons.

## File Structure

- `index.html` – Main homepage with hero, programs, events, join, and contact sections.  
- `events.html` – General events page with images and descriptions.  
- `event-5km.html` – Specific event page for the 5 km Parkrun.  
- `om-os.html` – About us page with mission and team info.  
- `styles.css` – Global styles for layout and responsiveness.  
- `interactivity.js` – JavaScript for form validation, tab interaction, popup forms, scrolling behavior, and language switching.  
- `Images/` – Folder containing all images used in the site (flags, event photos, team photos, etc.).  

## Technologies Used

- HTML for page structure.
- CSS3 for styling and responsive design.
- JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content.

## Possible Future Updates

There might be small updates for the website before the exam. The possible updates could be:

- Calling an API (or some other solution) to translate the text on the website (No translation does happen as yet).
- Being able to send messages to some mail (probably my own personal mail).
- Creating a simple newsfeed in `events.html`.
- Trying to work a bit further on making "Tilmeld dig" more responsive on a mobile phone.
- Trying to work a bit further on making the website more dynamic (countdown for events).

There is no guarantee that I succeed in doing these things, but this is what I intend to be working a bit on towards the exam.
